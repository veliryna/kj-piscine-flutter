# quizz-app

You need to develop a fully functional stateful Quizz app in Flutter that allows users to select a category and answer true or false questions related to the selected category.

Features:

-    The app needs to feature at least 5 different categories that the users can select from the main page, i.e, history, culture, math, geography, etc.
-    The app needs to feature at least 10 questions to each quizz, so you need to make sure each category has at least 10 questions as well.
-    Appropriate name and images must be added to all the selected categories. (follow the examples bellow)
-    Upon selecting a category, the app needs to display the corresponding image to that category, along with the question and true/false buttons.
-    After the user answers the question, the app needs to display whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
-    At the end of the quiz, the user must be presented with a view of the score he got and a button to go back to the main page.
